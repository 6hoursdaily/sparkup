Sparkup is written by Rico Sta. Cruz and is released under the MIT license.

This project is inspired by [Zen Coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/) of
[Vadim Makeev](http://pepelsbey.net). The Zen HTML syntax is forward-compatible with Sparkup
(anything that Zen HTML can parse, Sparkup can too).

The following people have contributed code to the project:

 - Guillermo O. Freschi (Tordek @ github)
   Bugfixes to the parsing system

 - Eric Van Dewoestine (ervandew @ github)
   Improvements to the VIM plugin
